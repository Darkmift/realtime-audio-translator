### **1. Backend Repository**
- **Purpose**: This repo will handle the **signaling server** logic and any other backend operations needed to serve both the PresenterUI and WatcherUI.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Express + Socket.IO** for the signaling server.
  - **API Endpoints** (if needed in later phases).
  - **STUN/TURN configurations** for WebRTC connections.
  - **Optional**: Database for storing session info (if required).

**Suggested Structure**:
```
/backend
  /src
    /controllers
    /services
    /routes
  server.ts
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
```

---

### **2. PresenterUI Repository**
- **Purpose**: This repo will contain the **presenter-facing UI** that captures and streams video/audio.
- **Key Components**:
  - React components for UI (e.g., video capture, media controls).
  - Hooks for handling WebRTC and Socket.IO communication.
  - Peer-to-peer connection setup.
  
**Suggested Structure**:
```
/presenter-ui
  /src
    /components
    /hooks
    /services
      /webRTCService.ts
    /pages
      App.tsx
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
```

### **3. WatcherUI Repository**
- **Purpose**: This repo will handle the **viewer-facing UI**, receiving and playing back video/audio streams.
- **Key Components**:
  - React components for viewing the video/audio streams.
  - Peer-to-peer connection management using WebRTC.
  - Real-time feedback and network status updates.

**Suggested Structure**:
```
/watcher-ui
  /src
    /components
    /hooks
    /services
      /webRTCService.ts
    /pages
      App.tsx
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
```

---

### **4. Lib Repository**
- **Purpose**: This repo will act as a shared library between the Backend, PresenterUI, and WatcherUI. It will include:
  - **Types**: Shared TypeScript types/interfaces (e.g., WebRTC config, user info, media settings).
  - **Components**: Reusable components, e.g., media controls, status indicators.
  - **Hooks**: Shared React hooks for WebRTC connection management, UI state, etc.

**Suggested Structure**:
```
/lib
  /src
    /types
      WebRTC.ts
      User.ts
    /components
      /MediaControls
        index.tsx
      /StatusIndicator
        index.tsx
    /hooks
      /useWebRTC.ts
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
```

**Key Considerations**:
- **Monorepo Approach**: using a **monorepo** tool like **Nx** or **Lerna** to manage all four repositories within a single repo. This would streamline dependencies, simplify versioning, and make it easier to share components/hooks between projects.
- **TypeScript**: having a shared **types** folder in the `lib` repo will help enforce consistent types across the entire stack.
- **CI/CD**: Consider setting up continuous integration workflows (using GitHub Actions, for example) to ensure that all repos are always in sync and tested.
