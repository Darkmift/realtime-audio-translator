### **MVP #1: Initial System**

**Components**:
1. **PresenterUI**:
   - Web app interface where the presenter can stream video and audio.
   - Use **WebRTC** to handle the real-time video and audio streaming from the presenter to the backend.

2. **WatcherUI**:
   - Web app interface for clients to view the presenter's video and audio in real time.
   - WebRTC will be used to receive the video and audio streams from the backend.

3. **Backend**:
   - Handles routing and relaying the video/audio streams.
   - **Node.js** as the signaling server for WebRTC, managing peer connections between the presenter and the watcher.
   - A simple media server (e.g., **Janus**, **Kurento**, or **Jitsi**) can handle the streaming from the presenter to multiple watchers.

**Focus**:
- Set up real-time streaming.
- Ensure low-latency video/audio delivery.
- Set up basic UI for presenter and watcher.

### **MVP #2: Adding Translation**

**Expansion of MVP #1**:
1. **Backend Translation Layer**:
   - The backend will now process the audio using **Google Speech-to-Text** to convert the presenter's spoken words into text in real-time.
   - The text will then be passed through the **Google Cloud Translation API** to translate the audio into the chosen language.

2. **WatcherUI**:
   - Add a **dropdown menu** that allows the watcher to select the language they want to hear the translated audio in.
   - Based on the watcher’s language choice, the backend will use **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** to send the translated audio in real time to the watcher.
   
**Focus**:
- Set up real-time translation of speech into text and then into different languages.
- Integrate text-to-speech conversion in real-time for multiple clients.

### **MVP #3: Customized Voice**

**Expansion of MVP #2**:
1. **AI Voice Cloning**:
   - Research and integrate **Voice Cloning AI** tools to generate the translated audio while retaining the characteristics of the presenter's voice.
   - Consider tools like **Google Cloud Custom Voice**, **Respeecher**, or **Descript**.
   
2. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Ensure the real-time processing still maintains low latency while using the customized voice.
   - Apply voice cloning to each translated output in the watcher’s chosen language.

**Focus**:
- Implement real-time voice cloning and synthesis.
- Maintain low latency and ensure the cloned voice sounds natural in various languages.
