### **1. ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)**

- **ICE** is a framework used by WebRTC to discover the best path for peer-to-peer communication between two devices (clients). It's responsible for finding the most efficient route to transmit audio, video, and data between peers.
- ICE works by gathering a set of possible connection candidates (IP addresses, ports, and protocols) and trying them out in real-time to determine which is the best path. These candidates can be:
  - **Host candidates**: Direct IP addresses of the devices on the local network.
  - **Server reflexive candidates**: Public IP addresses obtained via a **STUN** server.
  - **Relay candidates**: Public IP addresses from a **TURN** server when a direct connection is impossible.

**Summary**: ICE helps WebRTC find the best way to connect peers by testing multiple possible connection paths.

### **2. STUN/TURN Servers**

**STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)**:
- **STUN** servers help clients determine their **public IP addresses** and port mappings when they are behind a **NAT** (Network Address Translation), which is common for most routers.
- It’s used to resolve how devices on private networks can communicate with each other over the internet by providing external network information.
- **STUN** is lightweight and used when direct peer-to-peer communication is possible after discovering the public IP address.

**TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)**:
- **TURN** servers act as **relays** for the actual media (audio/video) between clients when a direct connection is not possible (e.g., due to strict NAT or firewall rules).
- TURN servers relay traffic between clients when other connection methods (host or STUN) fail. It’s more resource-intensive because the media data flows through the TURN server.

**Summary**:
- **STUN**: Used to discover the public IP of a device (for direct connections).
- **TURN**: Used when direct connections fail and the media must be relayed through a server.

### **3. SDP (Session Description Protocol)**

- **SDP** is a format for describing multimedia communication sessions.
- In WebRTC, **SDP** is used to exchange information about media types, formats, codecs, and network configurations between peers during the setup of the connection.
- **Offer/Answer**: During WebRTC connection setup:
  - The **offer** (sent by the initiating peer) describes the media (video/audio) and connection details.
  - The **answer** (sent by the receiving peer) responds with its own media and connection details.

**Summary**: SDP describes the media and network settings for a WebRTC session, allowing peers to negotiate how they will communicate.

### **4. Janus, Kurento, and Jitsi (Media Servers)**

**Janus**:
- A lightweight, open-source **WebRTC media server** designed to act as a relay between WebRTC peers.
- **Janus** is modular, meaning you can plug in various functionalities like video conferencing, recording, or scaling media streams for multiple clients.
- It’s known for being lightweight and highly customizable.

**Kurento**:
- A more feature-rich **media server** than Janus, **Kurento** offers advanced capabilities like media mixing, transcoding, filtering (applying effects), and recording.
- **Kurento** is ideal for applications where you need to process or manipulate the video/audio streams (e.g., adding filters, converting codecs).

**Jitsi**:
- **Jitsi** is a free, open-source platform for video conferencing with built-in WebRTC support.
- **Jitsi** offers complete solutions, including a media server, client-side interfaces, and back-end components for managing calls.
- It's commonly used for building scalable video conferencing apps.

**Summary**:
- **Janus**: Lightweight, modular WebRTC media server, great for scaling and relaying streams.
- **Kurento**: Feature-rich media server with advanced stream manipulation capabilities.
- **Jitsi**: Complete platform for video conferencing with WebRTC support.

### **5. K6**

- **K6** is an open-source **load testing** tool designed to test the performance of web applications, APIs, and systems under stress.
- It's particularly useful for testing real-time applications like WebRTC-based systems where you need to simulate multiple users interacting with the system at once.
- **K6** allows you to simulate concurrent users, monitor latency, bandwidth usage, and more to ensure your WebRTC app can handle the expected load.

**Summary**: K6 is a tool for load testing your application to ensure it performs well under heavy traffic.

### **How These Terms Fit Into Your System**:

- **ICE** will help establish peer-to-peer connections between the presenter and watchers.
- **STUN/TURN servers** are necessary for handling network configurations (especially in cases of NAT/firewall traversal).
- **SDP** is the protocol that will describe the multimedia session between the presenter and the watchers, negotiating the connection setup.
- **Janus/Kurento** could be useful if you need a media server to handle multiple watchers or to relay streams. You could also use **Jitsi** for video conferencing if you want a more complete solution.
- **K6** will be useful in later stages to stress-test your WebRTC implementation and ensure the system can handle multiple clients.
